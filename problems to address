NOTE - Git has an "issue" functionality directly related to each document. Since this is preliminary and we do not have documents yet I have put these issues here temporarily.

**Possible problems**
  - Someone dominating conversation, attention
  -      - Discussion timed with cell phone or hour glass
  -      - Small group mediators
  -  Decisions made that aren't from club consensus
  -      Ratification of collaborative edits
  -      - Member voting once every 2-3 months
  -      Large number of edits to vote each voting period
  -      Low member turnout for edit ratifications
  -      Too many elected positions
  -      Poor member recruitment
  -      Poor member turnout
  -      Small group repetition, no new influence, if same makeup of persons
  -      Document protection and backup. Vandalization, sabotage.
  -      Document checks and balances
  -      Who edits document ratification, how do we know they are honestly editing?
